You are given an array of integers arr . Your task is to reverse the given array and return the reversed array.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: [4, 3, 2, 1]
Explanation: The elements of the array are 1 2 3 4. After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position,
the second element goes to the second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is 4 3 2 1.
Input: arr = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The array has only single element, hence the reversed array is same as the original.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
1<=arr.size()<=105
0<=arr[i]<=105
